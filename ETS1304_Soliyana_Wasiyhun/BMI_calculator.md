# Algorithm(psedocode) for the BMI calculator


Make a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person and determine weather the person is in normal weight, under weight or over weight. BMI is calculated as (BMI = w/h*h). Make the program to work for multiple person before terminated?

* start 

* read the input as weight and height

* calculate the BMI as BMI = weight/height*height

* if BMI<18.5 then  weight=underweight

* if BMI >18.5 and BMI <24.9 then weight =normal weight

* if BMI >25 and BMI<29.9 then  weight =over weight

* if BMI >30 then weight= obese

* print weight

* read the input  choice 

* if (choice=1) then go to line

* if (choice =0)then finish 

* end
