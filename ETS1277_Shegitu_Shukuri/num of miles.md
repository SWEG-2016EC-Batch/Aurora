/* Write a program that prompts the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons
the automobiles can be driven. The program outputs the number miles the automobile can be driven
without refueling. */

Input - miles per gallon
      - amount of fuel in gallon
      
Output - The number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling

Algorithm
step1: start
step2: read miles_per_gallon
step3: read fuel_of_car
step4: calculate total mile, as
        mile= fuel_of_car* mile_per_gallon
step5:  display the result
step6:  end
