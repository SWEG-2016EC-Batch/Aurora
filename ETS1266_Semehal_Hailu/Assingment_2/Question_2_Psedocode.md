# Algorithm

## Queation

Write a program that read the various assessments, compute the total mark and print the corresponding letter-grade based on the following scale

* If mark is >=90 letter grade = A+

* If mark is >=80 letter grade = A

* If mark is >=75 letter grade = B+

* If mark is >=60 letter grade = B

* If mark is >=55 letter grade = C+

* If mark is >=45 letter grade = C

* If mark is >=30 letter grade = D

* If mark is <30 letter grade = F


### Assessments
➢ Test 15%, Quiz 5%, Project 20%, Assignment 10%, Final exam 50%
