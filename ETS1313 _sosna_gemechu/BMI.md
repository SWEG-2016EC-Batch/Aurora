## _psedocode

Make a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person and determine weather the person is
in normal weight, under weight or over weight. BMI is calculated as (BMI = w/h*h). Make the program to
work for multiple person before terminated.

-start
-read the input as (height, weight, and number)
-calculate body mass indedx(BMI) as BMI=weight/(height*height)
-if(BMI<18.5) then weight=under weight
-if(BMI>18.5 & BMI<24.9) then weight=normal weight
-if(BMI>24.918.5 & BMI<29.9) then weight=over weight
-if(BMI>29.9) then weight=obese
-Print weight
-read the input number 
-if (number=1) then goto line 2
-if(number=0) finish
-End
